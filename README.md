# Need a hug?

An app that gives you *a virtual hug* every time you click on the button.

I created it as a part of [Google EU Scholarship - Android Development for Beginners](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships). It was the first Android app I've ever made. 

During the last 3 months I documented all my progress on Udacity's forum. The forum will be closed after the scholarship's over, so ******I decided to publish my old posts [here](https://github.com/anna-wro/needahug/wiki) for future reference******.
